The Conquest is a 2D multiplatform open source turn based historical strategy
game written in C++ using Gosu as media library. It has several game modes such
as Quick battle, Campaign and Online multiplayer.

The game connects with a server that keeps track of global scoreboards. You can
compete against other players and try to be the #1 in the world!

The engine is historic period independent, so users can create maps, campaigns
or new civilizations based on whichever age they want.
